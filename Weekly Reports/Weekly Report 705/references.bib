  abstract = 	 {In this paper we demonstrate the limitations of common rigid-body contact models used in the robotics community by comparing them to a collection of data-driven and data-reinforced models that exploit underlying structure inspired by the rigid contact  paradigm. We evaluate and compare the analytical and data-driven contact models on an empirical planar impact data-set, and show that the learned models are able to outperform their analytical counterparts with a small training set.}
