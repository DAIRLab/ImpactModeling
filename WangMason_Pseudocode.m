%This is a starting pseudocode file to write down the flow of the code
%before we make changes to the main wang mason code file


%define the constants B1, B2, B3: ALL are COM initial position (x1 and y1), masses, radius of gyration dependant.
%define the constants So and Co: both are initial COM velocities dependant (ydot_1o, ....) and initial COM position dependant (x1 and y1),

%figure out a way to find mu (e dependant)
