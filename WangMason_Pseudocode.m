%Hi This is a starting pseudocode file to write down the flow of the code
%before we make changes to the main wang mason code file


%define the constants B1, B2, B3: ALL are COM initial position (x1 and y1), masses, radius of gyration dependant.
% ^ equations: 19-21

%define the constants So and Co: both are initial COM velocities dependant (ydot_1o, ....) and initial COM position dependant (x1 and y1),
% ^ equations: 22-23


%figure out a way to find mu (e dependant)


% define Mu_s: B3 and B1 dependant
% ^ equation: 34

%define and identify small s (constant name s) from the inequalities using an if statement.
% ^ equation: 49
% define P_d and P_q:
