#Wang Mason Model
#Our first goal was to understand and create a function that applies the Wang Mason model for impacts
#It takes in a given pre-impact state and returns the post impact state.

#We then took our code for the Wang Mason model and applied it to data from Nima Fazeli
#We looked at both dropping a square (s = 0.06m) as well as a an ellipse (Maj Axis = 0.07m, Minor Axis = 0.05m)
