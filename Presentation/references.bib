    abstract = "{This paper presents an analysis of a two-dimensional rigid-body collision with dry friction. We use Routh’s graphical method to describe an impact process and to determine the frictional impulse. We classify the possible modes of impact, and derive analytical expressions for impulse, using both Poisson’s and Newton’s models of restitution. We also address a new class of impacts, tangential impact, with zero initial approach velocity. Some methods for rigid-body impact violate energy conservation principles, yielding solutions that increase system energy during an impact. To avoid such anomalies, we show that Poisson’s hypothesis should be used, rather than Newton’s law of restitution. In addition, correct identification of the contact mode of impact is essential.}",

  abstract = 	 {In this paper we demonstrate the limitations of common rigid-body contact models used in the robotics community by comparing them to a collection of data-driven and data-reinforced models that exploit underlying structure inspired by the rigid contact  paradigm. We evaluate and compare the analytical and data-driven contact models on an empirical planar impact data-set, and show that the learned models are able to outperform their analytical counterparts with a small training set.}
